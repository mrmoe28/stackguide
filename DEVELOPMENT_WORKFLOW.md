# Development Workflow - StackGuideR

## Problem
We keep running into the same errors because we're:
- Testing on production instead of local
- Making changes without understanding the root cause
- Not having proper error visibility

## Better Workflow

### 1. Local Development First (ALWAYS)
```bash
# Start local dev server
pnpm dev

# Run on http://localhost:3002
# Test ALL changes here before pushing
```

### 2. Check Errors Properly
```bash
# Watch server logs
pnpm dev | grep -i error

# Check build errors
pnpm build

# Run type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Run linting
pnpm lint
```

### 3. Test Locally Before Production
- Open http://localhost:3002
- Test the feature completely
- Check browser console for errors
- Only push when it works locally

### 4. Simplified Database Approach
Instead of fighting with database saves, let's make chat work WITHOUT database first:

**Option A: Make database optional everywhere**
- Chat works without saving to DB
- Add DB saves as a bonus feature later

**Option B: Use localStorage instead**
- Store chat history in browser
- No database complexity
- Works instantly

**Option C: Use Vercel KV (Redis)**
- Simpler than PostgreSQL
- Built into Vercel
- No connection issues

### 5. Better Error Handling Pattern
```typescript
// Current (fails completely if one thing breaks):
const result = await getAI()
await saveToDb() // If this fails, user gets 500
return result

// Better (graceful degradation):
const result = await getAI()
try {
  await saveToDb() // If this fails, we still return AI result
} catch (e) {
  console.error('DB save failed, but AI worked')
}
return result
```

## Immediate Action Plan

1. **Fix local environment** - Get it working perfectly on localhost
2. **Remove database requirement** - Make chat work without DB saves
3. **Test locally** - Every feature tested at http://localhost:3002 first
4. **Deploy only working features** - Push only after local testing

## Questions to Answer Before Next Session

1. Do you actually need chat history saved to database?
2. Would localStorage be good enough for now?
3. Should we remove auth requirement and make it public for testing?
4. Do you want to use Vercel KV instead of PostgreSQL?

## Next Steps

**Simplify the app to bare minimum:**
- User types prompt → AI responds → Shows recommendations
- NO database saves
- NO auth required
- NO complex features

Once that works perfectly, THEN add features one by one.
