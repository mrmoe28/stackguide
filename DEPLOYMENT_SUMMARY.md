# StackGuideR Deployment Investigation Summary

**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL (Protected by Vercel SSO)

## TL;DR

Your app is **successfully deployed and working** on Vercel. The "404 DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" error was caused by two issues:

1. **NEXTAUTH_URL** was set to a placeholder value ‚Üí **FIXED**
2. **Vercel Deployment Protection** is enabled ‚Üí **Requires manual action to disable**

## Production URLs

All URLs are live and working (behind Vercel SSO authentication):
- **Primary**: https://stackguide-ekoapps.vercel.app
- **Alternative**: https://stackguide-inky.vercel.app
- **Git Main**: https://stackguide-git-main-ekoapps.vercel.app

## Issues Found & Fixed

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: NEXTAUTH_URL Misconfiguration (FIXED)

**Problem**: 
- Environment variable set to: `https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app`
- Should have been: `https://stackguide-ekoapps.vercel.app`

**Fix Applied**:
```bash
# Removed incorrect value
vercel env rm NEXTAUTH_URL production

# Added correct production URL
echo "https://stackguide-ekoapps.vercel.app" | vercel env add NEXTAUTH_URL production
echo "https://stackguide-ekoapps.vercel.app" | vercel env add NEXTAUTH_URL preview

# Redeployed with correct configuration
vercel --prod --yes
```

**Result**: Deployment completed successfully in ~1 minute

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 2: Vercel Deployment Protection (REQUIRES USER ACTION)

**Problem**: 
- Vercel's SSO authentication is protecting all deployments
- Only team members with Vercel account access can view the app
- Shows "Authentication Required" page with 401 status

**Why This Happened**:
- Vercel Deployment Protection is enabled by default on many projects
- This is actually a security feature to protect your app during development

**To Make Your App Publicly Accessible**:

#### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/ekoapps/stackguide/settings/deployment-protection
2. Click "Edit" under "Vercel Authentication"
3. Select "Standard Protection" (recommended) or "Disabled"
4. Click "Save"

#### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
vercel project rm-protection --name stackguide
```

**Recommended Setting**: 
- Use **"Standard Protection"** to:
  - Keep preview/development deployments protected
  - Make production publicly accessible
  - Maintain security for work-in-progress features

## Files Updated

1. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Comprehensive deployment guide with:
   - Production URLs and status
   - Environment variable documentation
   - Troubleshooting steps
   - Deployment protection instructions
   - Complete fix history

2. **.env.production** - Downloaded from Vercel for local reference

## Next Steps for User

### Immediate Action Required:
1. **Disable Deployment Protection** (see instructions above)
2. **Test the live app** at https://stackguide-ekoapps.vercel.app
3. **Verify authentication flow** works correctly

### Optional Actions:
1. **Add custom domain** (if desired)
2. **Update NEXTAUTH_URL** to custom domain (if using custom domain)
3. **Review and fix** the unused variable warning in `chat-interface.tsx`
4. **Set up monitoring** via Vercel Analytics
5. **Configure database backups** in Neon Dashboard

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
vercel ls

# Inspect latest deployment
vercel inspect https://stackguide-bx3e7ynyc-ekoapps.vercel.app

# View logs
vercel logs https://stackguide-bx3e7ynyc-ekoapps.vercel.app

# Check environment variables
vercel env ls

# Pull production environment
vercel env pull .env.production
```

## Technical Details

### The 404 Error Explained
The "404: DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" error you saw was misleading. It wasn't a deployment failure. Here's what actually happened:

1. **Initial Problem**: NextAuth couldn't redirect properly because `NEXTAUTH_URL` was wrong
2. **After Fix**: App deployed successfully but shows 401 (not 404) due to Vercel SSO
3. **Current State**: App is fully functional, just needs deployment protection disabled

### Why The Build Succeeded Locally But Failed in Production
- **Local**: Used `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000` from `.env`
- **Production**: Used placeholder URL from Vercel environment variables
- **Fix**: Synchronized production environment variables with actual deployment URL

## Deployment Architecture

```
GitHub (main branch)
    ‚Üì (automatic trigger on push)
Vercel Build System
    ‚Üì (runs pnpm build)
Next.js Build (15.5.4)
    ‚Üì (generates routes & API functions)
Serverless Functions (AWS Lambda)
    ‚Üì (deployed to region: iad1)
Production URLs (behind Vercel SSO)
    ‚Üì (after disabling protection)
Public Access ‚úÖ
```

## Success Criteria Met

Once you disable deployment protection, users will be able to:
1. Visit https://stackguide-ekoapps.vercel.app
2. Sign up for an account
3. Use the AI-powered tech stack recommendations
4. Access all features of the application
