## Known Issues & Bugs

### P0 (Critical - Blocks Core Functionality)

1. **Build Module Errors**
   - **Symptom:** Missing webpack chunks for formdata-node and next modules
   - **Repro:** Server logs show module not found errors
   - **Impact:** API calls may fail, page rendering unstable
   - **Fix:** `rm -rf .next && pnpm build`
   - **Evidence:** Dev server stderr output

2. **Missing Test User Account**
   - **Symptom:** Cannot run E2E tests
   - **Repro:** Tests require authenticated session
   - **Impact:** Test suite cannot execute
   - **Fix:** Create test user with: `email: test@example.com, password: Test123456!`

### P1 (High - Degraded Experience)

3. **API Endpoint Not Implemented: /api/recommendations/save**
   - **Symptom:** "Add to Stack" button calls non-existent endpoint
   - **Repro:** Click "Add to Stack" on recommendation card
   - **Expected:** Saves to database
   - **Actual:** 404 or network error
   - **Impact:** Users cannot save recommendations
   - **Fix:** Implement POST /api/recommendations/save endpoint
   - **Evidence:** stack-card.tsx:28-37

4. **User ID Type Mismatch**
   - **Symptom:** Chat API expects UUID but session.user.id may not be UUID
   - **Repro:** Send chat message with non-UUID user ID
   - **Expected:** Validation passes
   - **Actual:** Zod validation fails with 400
   - **Impact:** Chat fails for users without UUID IDs
   - **Fix:** Either convert user IDs to UUID or adjust validation schema
   - **Evidence:** api/chat/route.ts:8, dashboard/page.tsx:29

### P2 (Medium - Usability Issues)

5. **Missing ARIA Labels**
   - **Symptom:** Screen readers cannot identify some interactive elements
   - **Repro:** Run axe-core accessibility scan
   - **Impact:** Screen reader users cannot identify element purposes
   - **Fix:** Add aria-label to chat input, send button, sign out button
   - **Evidence:** Feature inventory analysis

6. **No Loading Skeleton**
   - **Symptom:** Page shows spinners but no skeleton loaders
   - **Impact:** User doesn't see structure while loading
   - **Fix:** Add skeleton UI for recommendations panel during initial load
   - **Evidence:** Code review - only spinner present

7. **Missing Error Boundaries**
   - **Symptom:** Component errors may crash entire page
   - **Impact:** One component failure affects whole app
   - **Fix:** Add React Error Boundaries around major components
   - **Evidence:** No error.tsx boundaries in component tree

### P3 (Low - Polish / Edge Cases)

8. **Chat Input Lacks Character Limit**
   - **Symptom:** No visible limit on message length
   - **Impact:** Users may send very long messages
   - **Fix:** Add maxLength attribute and character counter
   - **Evidence:** chat-interface.tsx:173-179

9. **No Keyboard Shortcut for Send**
   - **Symptom:** Enter key doesn't submit (must click button)
   - **Impact:** Slower for keyboard users
   - **Fix:** Add onKeyDown handler for Enter key
   - **Evidence:** Code review - only onClick handler

10. **Recommendations Not Persisted**
    - **Symptom:** Recommendations reset on page refresh
    - **Impact:** User loses context
    - **Fix:** Store recommendations in database or localStorage
    - **Evidence:** State only in React component

|--------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Time to Interactive | ~2.2s (dev) | < 3s | ✅ PASS |
| API Response Time | Varies (AI) | < 10s | ⚠️ VARIABLE |
| Bundle Size | Not measured | < 500KB | ⚠️ UNKNOWN |

## Screenshots Reference

Screenshots will be captured in `./screenshots/` when tests run:
- `smoke-page-loaded.png` - Initial dashboard view
- `interactions-chat-message-sent.png` - After sending message
- `interactions-recommendations-updated.png` - Recommendations panel populated
- `code-viewer-appeared.png` - Boilerplate code displayed
- `code-viewer-consent-dialog.png` - File system permission request
- `a11y-initial-scan.png` - Accessibility scan result
- (... and 30+ more screenshots per test)

---

## Test Execution Blockers

1. **No Test User Account**
   - Need to seed database with test user
   - Credentials: `test@example.com / Test123456!`

2. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` required for chat API
   - `DATABASE_URL` required for user/chat storage

3. **Build Errors Must Be Resolved**
   - Module not found errors prevent stable execution
   - Requires clean rebuild

4. **API Endpoint Implementation**
   - `/api/recommendations/save` needs to be built
   - Or tests need to mock this endpoint

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Running Tests)
1. ✅ Clear `.next` directory and rebuild: `rm -rf .next && pnpm build`
2. ⬜ Create test user in database
3. ⬜ Verify all environment variables are set
4. ⬜ Run single smoke test to verify setup: `npx playwright test 00-smoke.spec.ts --headed`

### Short Term (Test Execution)
5. ⬜ Run full test suite: `npx playwright test`
6. ⬜ Generate HTML report: `npx playwright show-report`
7. ⬜ Review and triage all failures
8. ⬜ Fix P0 and P1 issues

### Long Term (Improvements)
9. ⬜ Implement missing `/api/recommendations/save` endpoint
10. ⬜ Add ARIA labels for accessibility
11. ⬜ Add error boundaries
12. ⬜ Implement keyboard shortcuts
13. ⬜ Add loading skeletons
14. ⬜ Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
